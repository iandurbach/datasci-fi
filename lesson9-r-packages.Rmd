```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

R packages bundle together code, data, documentation, and tests, and are easy
to share with others. There are already well over 10,000 packages available on
the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and R users quickly become
familiar with the process of installing and using R packages as part of their
workflow.

In this lesson we'll look at the process of creating an R package. It's a lot 
easier than you might think!

Here is a quick overview of what we'll cover:

* Why build R packages?
* What do you need?
* Basic setup process
* Documentation
* Testing
* Sharing & collaboration
* Other Topics (not covered)
* Review
* Learn More

## Why build R packages?

There are a number of reasons why you should want to know how to build an R 
package:

* To share code with others (or even just with yourself)
* To leverage existing tooling for consistency & efficiency
* Learning about package development has spin-off benefits for everyone

### Sharing code

Bundling code into a package makes it easy for other people to use it, since
it's likely that they already know how to install and learn to use an R
package. Even if you just want to share code across multiple projects of your
own, an R package is often the best way to do this.

### Leveraging tooling

The standardised conventions of R packages have lead to standardised tooling,
particularly in the key areas of documentation and testing. So by buying into
R's package conventions when bundling up code, you get the benefits of these
tools.

### Package learnings benefit everyone

The learning process involved in creating your own R packages will improve
your understanding of existing R packages and also of R itself, and will equip
you to contribute back to the community with feature additions, improved
documentation, bug fixes etc for these packages. In short, learning unlocks
opportunities for further learning.

## What do you need?

The [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) is highly 
useful for package development due to its integration with `devtools` but is not
required.

You'll need the following R packages:

* [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)
* [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen)
* [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr)
* [testthat](https://github.com/hadley/testthat)

In addition to `devtools` you'll likely need (at some point) to have a 
development environment setup. For pure R packages which don't require any 
compiled code this isn't necessary.

You may already have what you need, or the `devtools` package installation 
process may automatically take care of this for you. You can check that you have
what you need with:

```{r}
library(devtools)
has_devel()
```

If the above returns `TRUE`, then you're good to go. If not, then you'll 
probably need to do a manual install/setup, and the process will depend on the 
platform you're on:

- Windows: [Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
- Mac: [xcode](http://developer.apple.com/downloads)
- Linux: [r-base-dev](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/)

For this lesson we'll only require `devtools` itself, so feel free to skip the 
above (Rtools/xcode/r-base-dev) for now if you want to.

## Basic Setup Process

Ok, so onto the basic steps involved in creating an R package.

#### Create a skeleton project (package directory)

Let's create a package project called `datasci`.

In RStudio you can do this very easily with:

> File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R package

However, lets use `devtools` directly instead:

```{r}
devtools::create("datasci")
```

This will create the directory `datasci/` within your current working directory.
It should contain an empty `R` folder as well as a few other files - 
`DESCRIPTION`, `NAMESPACE`, `.Rbuildignore`, `datasci.Rproj` etc.

Open up the new project in RStudio, and build & reload the package:

> Build -> Build & Reload (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B)

This will build and install the package, restart your R session, and (re)load
the package. The package is empty at this point, so this step is fairly
meaningless, apart from just checking that things are setup and working
correctly.
It is worth emphasizing this step upfront however, since it is of crucial
importance later on once you get into the flow of making updates to your
package and testing them.
Note that you can also achieve the same thing with:

> Build -> Load all (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L)

or:

```{r}
devtools::load_all()
```

`Load all` and `Build & Reload` actually do slightly different things, but
either is fine for now. `Load all` simulates the process of installing and
loading a package (but doesn't actually install the package). This makes it
less thorough but more efficient than `Build & Reload`. We'll revisit the
differences between these again when we look at Documentation.

### Add function(s)

Let's add a function to the package. All R code for a package goes in the `R/`
directory. Create a new file `add.R` within the `R` directory of your package
project which contains the following:

```{r}
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

`Load all` changes to the package as before (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L).

You should now be able to call the `add()` function from the R console e.g:

```{r}
add(1, 1)
```

So now we've got a basic package which contains a function for addition. But 
it's missing documentation:

```{r}
?add
```

## Documentation

Documentation for R packages goes in the `man/` directory. R has a special file 
format for documentation which uses the file extension `.Rd`. It looks quite 
similar to LaTeX in some respects. Here is the content of `desc.Rd` in the 
`dplyr` package:

```
\name{desc}
\alias{desc}
\title{Descending order}
\usage{
desc(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{vector to transform}
}
\description{
Transform a vector into a format that will be sorted in descending order.
This is useful within \code{\link[=arrange]{arrange()}}.
}
\examples{
desc(1:10)
desc(factor(letters))

first_day <- seq(as.Date("1910/1/1"), as.Date("1920/1/1"), "years")
desc(first_day)

starwars \%>\% arrange(desc(mass))
}
```

If you compare this to the output of `?dplyr::desc` in R, you'll see that the
`.Rd` file format is not too hard to make sense of. However, it is not ideal
to have to keep the documentation for each function in a package up to date in
a separate `.Rd` file that lives in another folder within the package. 

This was one of the primary motivations behind the development of `roxygen` - it
allows documentation to live with the R code itself. This is achieved by
including specialized comments above the function definition i.e. you get to
'attach' documentation to the R code for a function. These comments can then
be knitted into .Rd files as part of the package build process. 

Let's take a look at the Roxygen comments for `desc()` in dplyr to see where 
`desc.Rd` originated:
```
#' Descending order
#'
#' Transform a vector into a format that will be sorted in descending order.
#' This is useful within [arrange()].
#'
#' @param x vector to transform
#' @export
#' @examples
#' desc(1:10)
#' desc(factor(letters))
#'
#' first_day <- seq(as.Date("1910/1/1"), as.Date("1920/1/1"), "years")
#' desc(first_day)
#'
#' starwars %>% arrange(desc(mass))
desc <- function(x) -xtfrm(x)
```

Note that Roxygen comments begin with `#'` so you can continue to use regular
comments for other purposes. Roxygen comments also incorporate different tags
(e.g. `@examples`) for different sections. In some cases the tags themselves
are optional even though the sections are required - for example the very
first line corresponds to the `@title` for the help page and the following
paragraph is used for the `@description`. Further `@details` are optional. One
of the best places to get familiar with Roxygen comments and tags is the
`roxygen2` package vignette on [Generating .Rd
files](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html).
For now, let's start by initializing `roxygen2` for the `datasci` package:

```{r}
roxygen2::roxygenise()
```

This will update the `NAMESPACE` & `DESCRIPTION` and create the `man/` directory.

The update to `DESCRIPTION` is just to include the `RoxygenNote` field which 
specifies which version of Roxygen the package is using.

If you inspect the `NAMESPACE` file you'll see that the first line is:

```
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
```

Essentially `roxygen2` performs two key tasks based on two sets of tags: 

* some tags (e.g. `@param`, `@examples` etc) are used to generate `.Rd` files in
  `man/`
* other tags (e.g. `@export`) are used to generate/manage the package 
  `NAMESPACE`

By only using certain tags, it is possible to leverage Roxygen only for
documentation or only for namespace management, but I recommend you embrace
Roxygen fully and use it for both. This means that the above directive (not
editing the `NAMESPACE` by hand) should be adhered to. For more on namespaces,
I suggest you read the [section on
namespaces](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html) in Hadley's book.

Next let's add Roxygen comments to `add()`. Open up `add.R` in the RStudio 
script editor (if you don't have it open already) and place your cursor within 
the body of the function.

You should now be able to insert a roxygen skeleton for the function as follows:

> Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + R)

Then update the content as shown below:

```{r}
#' Add numbers together
#'
#' @param x First number
#' @param y Second number
#'
#' @return Sum of the first and second number
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(20, 22)
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

Once you've done this, you should then run:

```{r}
devtools::document()
```

Alternatively you can also use Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D. This is a helper function
which calls `roxygenise()` behind the scenes. It will generate the file
`add.Rd` in `man/`, and update `NAMESPACE` to export the `add()` function.

Note that if you don't include the `@export` tag in your function
documentation, the function will remain unexported, which means that the
function will not be directly accessible when the package is loaded/attached.
It often makes sense for certain utility functions within packages to remain
unexported since though they may be used/shared by various functions within a
package, these functions themselves often are directly useable (or useful)
outside of the package environment.

You can now view the help for the `add()` function with:

```{r}
?add
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lesson9/datasci_documentation.png")
```

Obviously this is just a very simple example of function documentation to 
illustrate the process. I recommend you read the other [vignettes for roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/) in order
to learn more.

Note that it's also possible to document other objects e.g. datasets - in fact,
every object exported by a package should be documented and the package itself
should also be documented. Hadley's book has a [section on object documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) which is a good reference for 
this.

Another thing that's worth mentioning here is an alternative workflow for
documentation (and package dev iteration in general). The first documentation
workflow (`devtools::load_all()`) is very fast, but it does have a limitation
- the preview documentation pages won't show links between pages. If you need
to also see links, you can instead use Build and Reload (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift +
B), which will update, install it as part of your package library, and then
restart R and reload the package. This is slower but more thorough, so is
worth doing on ocassion after making a number of small (or big) changes to a
package and/or it's documentation. In order to make sure that all the
documentation is regenerated as part of the package build process, you'll need
to configure the Roxygen options within the Build Tools section of Project
Options in RStudio as shown below:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lesson9/build_reload_options.png")
```

## Testing

```{r}
devtools::use_test("add")
```

Behind the scenes this will first call `devtools::use_testthat()`, which will
create `tests/testthat.R`, `tests/testthat/` and add `testthat` to the
suggested packages. Then it will create the file `tests/testhat/test-add.R`
which contains an example test:
```
context("add")

test_that("multiplication works", {
  expect_equal(2 * 2, 4)
})
```

Let's replace/update the content of `test-add.R` with a few tests for our 
`add()` function:

```
context("numeric addition is correct")

test_that("1 + 1 equals 2", {
  expect_equal(add(1, 1), 2)
})

test_that("1 + -1 equals 0", {
  expect_equal(add(1, -1), 0)
})

context("non-numeric input results in an error")

test_that("string input results in an error", {
  expect_error(add("1", 1))
})
```

You can now run these tests with:

```{r}
devtools::test()
```

You should then see output in the RStudio build pane as shown below:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/lesson9/datasci_testing.png")
```

Note that all of the code, documentation and test examples outlined here can be
found within the [`datasci` package](docs/lesson9-material/packages/datasci).

## Sharing & Collaboration

Although it hasn't been stated until now, it should be a given that you use
Git (or if necessary something else) for version control for the reasons
outlined in lesson 1. This should take place long before you get to the stage
where you might think about sharing your package with a wider audience.

If you're going to share your package, then there are a few additional steps
and things to consider. Much of this relates to package metadata, and one of
the best places to get an overview of this is the [description
chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) in Hadley's book on R
packages.

For now we'll just outline a few of the more obvious step to work through.

### Update package information in the `DESCRIPTION`

Package title, description, author information etc.

### Add a software license

The two most commonly used software licenses for R packages are the MIT
license and the GPL3 license. `devtools` includes functions for adding these
to a package: `use_mit_license()` and `use_gpl3_license()`. Note that the MIT
license requires you to include a `LICENSE` file - the `devtools` helper
function will create this file and all you need to do is update the copyright
holder field with your name. https://tldrlegal.com/ and
https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ are two good places to get more
information on different software licenses, and the R project website also has
[a page](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/) which lists the licenses in use
for R packages.

### Add a package README

It's a really good idea to create a `README` for your package - especially for
example if you will be sharing your package on GitHub. The package `README`
should outline the basics of why someone might want to use your package, how
they should use your package and how to install your package e.g.
`devtools::install_github('username/packagename')`.

The `README` should be in markdown, but if you want to include code examples, 
it's usually easier to write it with Rmarkdown and then knit to GitHub flavoured
markdown. `devtools` contains a helper function to assist with this:

```{r}
devtools::use_readme_rmd()
```

This will create a template `README.Rmd` which you can edit and then `knit` to 
generate `README.md`.

### Add a package vignette

Vignettes are more longform documentation which act as a guide for how to use 
your package. See the 
[section on vignettes in Hadley's book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)
for an overview.

Again, `devtools` contains a nifty function to get you started with a template 
vignette:

```{r}
devtools::use_vignette("my-vignette")
```

Another very useful tool is the 
[goodpractice](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice) package. After 
installing it, simply run `goodpractice::gp("<my-package>")`. It will analyze 
your code and give you advice on package conventions, things to avoid and 
suggested best practice when developing an R package!

## Other Topics (not covered)

* Namespaces, scoping etc - `NAMESPACE`
* Compiled code (e.g. `Rcpp`) - `src/`
* Installed files - `inst/`
* Data - `data/`
* Versioning, dependencies etc - `DESCRIPTION`
* CRAN - preparing your package for submission (e.g. `NEWS.md`)

All of the above topics are covered very nicely in [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).

## Review

### R code workflow

* Edit an `.R` file.

* `devtools::load_all()` (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + L in RStudio)

* Explore the function(s) & code in the console.

* Rinse and repeat.

### Documentation workflow

* Add roxygen comments to your `.R` files.

* Run `devtools::document()` (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + D in RStudio) to convert roxygen comments to `.Rd` files.

* Preview documentation with `?`.

* Rinse and repeat until the documentation looks the way you want.

### Testing workflow

* Modify your code in `R/` or tests in `tests/testthat/`.

* Test your package with `devtools::test()` (or Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T in RStudio).

* Repeat until all tests pass.

In addition to reading books, websites, blog posts etc, another great way to
learn about R package development is to just explore the source code for
various packages that you are already familiar with on GitHub and see what you
can learn by just piecing together how the package authors/maintainers have
done things. Good candidates are mature and actively maintained `tidyverse`
packages like [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr),
[tidyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr) and
[stringr](https://github.com/tidyverse/stringr). NA
